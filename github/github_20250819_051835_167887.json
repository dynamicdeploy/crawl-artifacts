    "description": "The onion architecture, introduced by Jeffrey Palermo, overcomes the issues of the layered architecture with great ease. With Onion Architecture, the game-changer is that the Domain Layer (Entities and Validation Rules that are common to the business case ) is at the Core of the Entire Application. This means higher flexibility and lesser coupling. In this approach, we can see that all the Layers are dependent only on the Core Layers.",
